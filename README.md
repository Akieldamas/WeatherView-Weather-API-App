# WeatherView (Weather App)  

## üéØ Objective  
The main objective of this project was to:
- Work with an **existing public API** to retrieve weather data.
- Implement **data saving** techniques (e.g., saving names and favorite cities to `txt` files or `app.xaml`).
- Focus on **UI/UX** for a compact, mobile-like interface on a desktop app.  

## üìù Description  
This is a **Weather App** developed in **WPF C#** as the **3rd project** for my **1st year programming class** (after the Hangman game). The app was designed to test working with APIs and saving data in the app (like names in `Name.txt` or favorite cities in `FavoriteCities.txt`).  

It features a **clean, mobile-like interface** for a desktop app, providing key weather information in a compact and user-friendly manner.  

### **Language Note:**  
- The app is **primarily in French**, as it uses a **French API** (from [Pr√©vision M√©t√©o](https://www.prevision-meteo.ch/)).  
- While the weather-related information such as **temperature, humidity**, and **wind speed** will be displayed in **English**, the app's UI and some details will be in **French** due to the API language.  

Key features include:  
- **Current temperature** (Max, Min, and Current temperatures).  
- **Weather conditions** (e.g., sunny, rainy, etc.).  
- **Humidity, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset times**.  
- **Weather forecast** for the next 3 days.  
- **Search bar** to search for cities.  
- **Favorite Cities** can be saved by pressing the star button and can be accessed from the top combobox. (They are saved in `FavoriteCities.txt`)
- **Name** is saved in `Name.txt` for personalization.  

The app uses a **public API** from [Pr√©vision M√©t√©o](https://www.prevision-meteo.ch/), which covers cities across **France, Italy, Belgium**, and more. Not all global cities are supported, but it offers great coverage for several European countries.  

### Key Features:  
- **Date and Day of the Week** are displayed.  
- Save and access **favorite cities** from the combobox.  
- **Search bar** for quick city look-up.  
- **API-driven** weather data and updates.
